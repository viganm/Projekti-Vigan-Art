		<h1>KOSOVO and its Natural Beauties</h1><br>

		<p>Kosovo is a small and landlocked disputed territory in Southeastern Europe. The country is strategically
			positioned in the center of the Balkan Peninsula enclosed by Montenegro to the west, Serbia to the north and
			east, North Macedonia to the southeast, and Albania to the southwest. It has no direct access to the
			Mediterranean Sea but its rivers flow into three seas, the Adriatic, Aegean and Black Sea.<br><br>

			The country possesses impressive and contrasting landscapes determined by the climate along with the geology
			and hydrology. Both, the Prokletije and Å ar Mountains, are the most defining feature of the country and
			simultaneously the most biodiverse regions of Kosovo. As far as the central region, the plains of Dukagjin
			and Kosovo stretches over the west and east, respectively.</p>
